Bonus: Trinidad
===============

Blissful JRuby web application server.

* Uses Tomcat under the covers
* Absurdly easy to install and use

    jruby -S gem install trinidad
    cd ~/my-awesome-project
    trinidad

And it just works, like magic!

(This is notable because nothing ever works easily on Windows)
